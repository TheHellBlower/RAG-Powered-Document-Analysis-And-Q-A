# PDF Document Analyzer (Q&A Chatbot & Summarizer)

This project is a Streamlit web application that allows you to upload a PDF document and interact with it in two ways:

1. **Chatbot (Q&A):** Ask specific questions about the document's content using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

2. **Summarizer:** Generate a detailed, bullet-pointed summary of the entire document.

This application was developed by combining the two projects from an original Jupyter Notebook, converting the logic into a deployable app. It uses LangChain and leverages the free, open-source **Llama 3** model from Hugging Face for all language tasks, requiring no paid API keys.
